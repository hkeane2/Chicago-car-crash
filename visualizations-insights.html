         <h1>Visualizations and Insights</h1>
         <p>We organized our data into a series of visualizations, separated by our vehicles dataset and our people dataset. All visualizations are shown below, with insights we gleaned from our data underneath each visualization. For each category of visualization (i.e. Vehicle Analysis and Driver/Victim Analysis), we include visualizations for our Halloween data and our non-Halloween comparative data. Visualizations are also interactive, so users can explore the data more in-depth by hovering their mouse over figures.</p>
